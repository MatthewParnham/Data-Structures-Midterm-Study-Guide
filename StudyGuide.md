# Algorithm Analysis 
* Algorithm : A process or set of rules to be followed to solve a problem
	
## Empirical (Experimental) Analysis
* Analysis performed by implementing two algorithms and run an experiment with the same input.
### Benefits
* Extremely accurate results (Actual runtime calculated)
### Disadvantages
* Not good for large data sets
* Cost efficient
* Difficult/lengthy to implement algorithms.
* Dependent on many variables i.e. platform/hardware and compilers/linkers

## Mathematical/Asymptotic Analysis (Theoretical Analysis)
Analysis that determines factors that determine the run-time of algorithm
* input
* Quality of code
Run time depends on input (specifically the size)
* Algorithm can be defined as a function of the input
* Take into account all possible inputs
### Benefits
* Very cost efficient
* Not dependent on many variables (e.g. hardware, compiler, linker)
### Disadvantages
* Less accurate than empirical analysis
